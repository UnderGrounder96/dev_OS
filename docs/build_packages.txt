# wget build packages

ROOT_DIR=dev_OS/; inside the VM it becomes /vagrant

Execute the following commands to download the build packages:

cd dev_OS/
ROOT_DIR=$PWD

# Downloads the most recent wget-list from lfs to --output-document=PATH
wget https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/wget-list --output-document=$ROOT_DIR/configs/packages_list.txt

# Gets the packages from the wget-list to --directory-prefix=PATH
wget --no-check-certificate --timestamping --progress=bar:force \
  --show-progress --rejected-log=$ROOT_DIR/wget_rejected_list.log \
  --input-file=$ROOT_DIR/configs/packages_list.txt --directory-prefix=$ROOT_DIR/bin

## Explanation from https://github.com/reinterpretcat/lfs

Binutils - contains a linker, an assembler, and other tools for handling object files

GCC - contains the GNU compiler collection, which includes the C and C++ compilers

Linux - (API Headers) expose the kernel's API for use by Glibc

Glibc - (GNU LibC) contains the main C library. This library provides the basic routines for allocating memory,
searching directories, opening and closing files, reading and writing files, string handling, pattern
matching, arithmetic, and more

Libstdc++ is the standard C++ library. It is needed for the correct operation of the g++ compile

TCL - contains the Tool Command Language.

Expect - contains a program for carrying out scripted dialogues with other interactive programs

DejaGNU - contains a framework for testing other programs

M4 - contains a macro processor

Ncurses - contains libraries for terminal-independent handling of character screens

Bash - contains the Bourne-Again SHell

Bzip2 - contains programs for compressing and decompressing files. Compressing text
files with bzip2 yields a much better compression percentage than with the traditional gzip

Coreutils - contains utilities for showing and setting the basic system characteristics

Diffutils - contains programs that show the differences between files or directories

File - contains a utility for determining the type of a given file or files

Findutils - contains programs to find files. These programs are provided to recursively
search through a directory tree and to create, maintain, and search a database (often faster
than the recursive find, but unreliable if the database has not been recently updated)

Gawk - contains programs for manipulating text files

Gettext - contains utilities for internationalization and localization. These allow programs to be
compiled with NLS (Native Language Support), enabling them to output messages in the user's native language

Grep - contains programs for searching through files

Gzip - contains programs for compressing and decompressing files

Make - contains a program for compiling packages

Patch - contains a program for modifying or creating files by applying a "patch" file
typically created by the diff program

Perl - contains the Practical Extraction and Report Language

Sed - contains a stream editor

Tar - contains an archiving program

Texinfo - contains programs for reading, writing, and converting info pages

Util-linux - contains miscellaneous utility programs

Xz - contains programs for compressing and decompressing files. It provides capabilities for the
lzma and the newer xz compression formats. Compressing text files with xz yields a better compression
percentage than with the traditional gzip or bzip2 commands
