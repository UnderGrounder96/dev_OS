# Configure flags
## Explanation from buildyourownlinux

--------------------------------------------------- Stage 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------

../binutils-*/configure      \
  --prefix=/tools            \
  --with-sysroot=$BROOT      \
  --target=$BTARGET          \
  --disable-nls              \
  --disable-werror

prefix :: Tells the configure script where the compiled binaries should be installed.
with-sysroot :: Tells the configure script to look in the specified directory for the target system libraries.
target :: Because the triplet we've defined is slightly different than what will be determined by configure itself, the binutils source needs to be compiled to accommodate cross-linking. This is necessary because we want to ensure a "clean room" build, without any artifacts from the build system.
disable-els :: Disables internationalization, which we don't need at this stage.
disable-werror :: Keeps warnings from interrupting the compile process.

../gcc-10.2.0/configure                          \

  --disable-libgomp                              \

  --enable-languages=c,c++

target :: Tells make to use the target triplet located in our environment variable.
prefix :: Instructs make to use the specified path to prefix relative pathnames.kss
with-glibc-version :: Indicates which version of glibc we're going to target.
with-sysroot :: Specifies the system root and allows us to specify a different
root path than that of the currently-running kernel.
with-newlib :: Prevents any code which requires libc from being compiled (because we haven't built libc yet).
without-headers :: If building a full-blown cross-compiler, GCC needs the header files compatible with the target system. This argument instructs configure and make not to look for them, as we don't need them for this stage.
with-local-prefix :: This instructs configure and make to search the specified directory for include files.
with-native-system-header-dir :: This changes the default include path for headers (which is normally /usr/include) to /tools/include. Without this switch, GCC will look in the default location for include files, and that will break our build since our header files are located in /tools/include.
disable-shared :: Advises GCC to avoid performing static linking. This is a good idea simply because it avoids any conflicts that might arise if GCC were built to use shared libraries, as the system linker might attempt to link them with the libraries installed on the build system.
disable-decimal :: This GCC extension is not compatible when building GCC for cross compilation.
disable-float :: See disable-decimal.
disable-threads :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libatomic :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libgomp :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libmpx :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libquadmath :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libssp :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libvtv :: See disable-decimal.
disable-libstdcxx :: See disable-decimal.
disable-multilib :: This functionality isn't supported on the x86_64 platform.
enable-languages :: For this stage, we need GCC to compile only C and C++. This disables the compilation of compilers for other languages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "libc_cv_forced_unwind" variable impacts the handling of the libc-cv-force-unwind configuration parameter. The linker we installed when we compiled binutils is cross-compiled and cannot make use of the libc-cv-force-unwind option unless glibc is present. This variable disables this test.

The "libc_cv_c_cleanup" variables instruct configure to disable the test for this functionality, again for the same reasons given for libc\_cv\_forced\_unwind.

The commands for the configuration process should look like this:

export libc_cv_forced_unwind=yes
export libc_cv_c_cleanup=yes

../glibc-2.33/configure                         \
  --prefix=/tools                               \
  --host=$BTARGET                               \
  --build=$(../glibc-2.33/scripts/config.guess) \
  --enable-kernel=3.2                           \
  --with-headers=/tools/include

prefix :: Instructs make to use the specified path to prefix's relative pathnames.
host :: Tells make to use the target triplet located in our environment variable.
build :: Combined with the host flag, this instructs glibc's build system to configure itself to cross compile, using the cross-linker and compiler in /tools.
enable-kernel :: Instructs glibc to use workarounds for this specific version (and later) of the kernel.
with-headers :: Specifies the location of header files, so libc knows what features the kernel has and can configure itself accordingly.

../gcc-10.2.0/libstdc++-v3/configure         \
  --host=$BTARGET                            \
  --prefix=/tools                            \
  --disable-multilib                         \
  --disable-nls                              \
  --disable-libstdcxx-threads                \
  --disable-libstdcxx-pch                    \
  --with-gxx-include-dir=/tools/$BTARGET/include/c++/6.2.0

host :: Specifies the use the cross compiler we have just built instead of the one in /usr/bin.
disable-libstdcxx-pch :: This switch prevents the installation of precompiled include files, which are not needed at this stage.
with-gxx-include-dir :: This is the location where the C++ compiler should search for the standard include files. In a normal build, this information is automatically passed to the libstdc++ configure options from the top level directory. In our case, this information must be explicitly given.

export CC=$BTARGET-gcc
export AR=$BTARGET-ar
export RANLIB=$BTARGET-ranlib

../binutils-2.36.1/configure \
  --prefix=/tools            \
  --disable-nls              \
  --disable-werror           \
  --with-lib-path=/tools/lib \
  --with-sysroot

with-sysroot :: Specifying no value here enables the linker to find shared libraries required by other objects. Without this flag, make may not be able to locate and link some required libraries.
with-lib-path :: Here we're instructing make to use the specified directory explicitly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PKG_CONFIG= ./util-linux-*.*.*/configure --prefix=/tools \
  --without-python                      \
  --disable-makeinstall-chown           \
  --without-systemdsystemunitdir

without-python :: This disables the Python bindings, which we don't need at this point.
disable-makeinstall-chown :: make tries to change the owner of the binaries after copying them into place. This requires root permissions, however, so we disable this.
without-systemdsystemunitdir :: This instructs make to skip the installation of systemd-specific files.
