![dev_OS](img/logos/logo_transp.png)

## Getting Started

My intent is to create a slim, sleek and smart OS for developers.

I will use this repo to document all my progress.

I plan to use [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) for virtualization and [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org) as provider.

## Prerequisites

- Vagrant 2.2.16
- VirtualBox 6.1.26
- Fedora 25 (VM)

## Deployment

After installing Vagrant and VirtualBox, one could build dev_OS by running:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager vagrant-scp

bash vagrant_start.sh
```
